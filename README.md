🧠 AI Interview Prep Bot

AI Interview Prep Bot is an interactive web-based learning tool designed to help students master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through practical, interview-style questions.
It uses C++ for backend logic and HTML/CSS for frontend design to create a simple yet effective DSA learning experience.

🚀 Features

⚙️ Backend in C++ — Handles logic, algorithms, and question evaluation

🎨 Frontend with HTML & CSS — Clean, user-friendly interface

💬 Interactive Question System — Practice DSA like real interviews

🧠 Step-by-Step Learning — Understand concepts through examples

📈 Skill Improvement — Track and enhance problem-solving ability

🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	HTML, CSS
Backend	C++
Algorithm	DSA concepts (Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching)
🧩 How It Works

The bot generates DSA-based interview questions.

Users solve problems and input their logic.

The backend (C++) processes the response and provides feedback or hints.

Learners can track progress and revisit concepts easily.

📚 Learning Goals

Strengthen understanding of core DSA concepts

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving

Prepare for technical interviews with real-like practice

Learn how C++ logic connects with web UI
